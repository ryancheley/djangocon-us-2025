Change the order of the fields to have `chads_score` at end since it's the one we just added

Show an image of the database from pgAdmin

`The Documentation Gap`

Multiple slides for each of the points you make

Have a set of slides showing telephone game with 3 people ... and then 6 people and then 12 people and then 24 people ... etc to really drive home the point about undocumented expertise

Make sure the help_text is consistent on all slides

Update note to indicate the help text is available in Django admin and front end data entry forms

In general this slide kind of sucks and starts at 7:32 and ends at 8:18

`Django's 4.2 db_comment`

Make sure the db_comments are all consistent

`What this Generates`

Display the image from pgAdmin after this slide

For the self documenting models made each field it's own slide

Insert the images of the fields from pgAdmin after each slide

Have a better intro / segue for the `Complex Example - JSON Fields`

`Complete Context - Table-Level Documentation`

We may know more about the fields, but do we know as much as we can about the table that will hold these fields? Not yet, but we can. Also introduced in 4.2 was the `db_table_comment`

Remove the reference to the nightly update job

Add emailed address for the Cardio Team

Remove `The Migration` slide

`Both Features working together`

Be sure to indicate that you can / should add data validation on the data entry form
