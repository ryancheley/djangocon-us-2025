# The Real Cost

- ETL pipeline delays waiting for field clarification

--

- Report development blocked on dimension requirements

--

- Developer productivity loss across teams

--

- Regulatory compliance challenges

???

Let me be clear about the real business impact here. This isn't just a minor inconvenience.

ETL pipelines get delayed because data engineers don't know what fields contain.

Report development stops because business intelligence teams can't create accurate dashboards without understanding the data.

Developer productivity suffers across all teams - not just the original developer.

And in healthcare, regulatory compliance is critical. Auditors need to understand what data we're storing and how we're using it.
