# The Real Cost

- ETL pipeline delays

???

waiting for field clarification

--

- Report development blocked

???

on dimension requirements

--

- Developer productivity loss

???

Not just for the ETL Developers, or the Report Developers, but also for the Web Developers


???

Let me be clear about the real business impact here. This isn't just a minor inconvenience.

ETL pipelines get delayed because data engineers don't know what fields contain.

Report development stops because business intelligence teams can't create accurate dashboards without understanding the data.

Developer productivity suffers across all teams - not just the original developer.
