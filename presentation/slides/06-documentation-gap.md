# The Documentation Gap

???

Why don't traditional documentation approaches work?

--

- Code comments â‰  Database documentation

???

Code comments are great for developers reading code, but they don't help DBAs or data analysts who are working directly with the database.

--

- Wiki pages get stale

???

Wiki pages and Confluence docs get stale quickly. Someone updates the code but forgets to update the documentation.

--

- Undocumented expertise doesn't scale

???

Undocumented expertise - the "just ask Sarah, she knows" approach - doesn't scale and creates single points of failure.

--

- Regulatory auditors need field-level documentation

???

And in healthcare, we have regulatory requirements. Auditors need to see field-level documentation to understand what data we're storing about patients.
