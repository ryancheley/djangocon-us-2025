# The Documentation Gap

- Code comments â‰  Database documentation

--

- Wiki pages get stale

--

- Undocumented expertise doesn't scale

--

- Regulatory auditors need field-level documentation

???

Why don't traditional documentation approaches work?

Code comments are great for developers reading code, but they don't help DBAs or data analysts who are working directly with the database.

Wiki pages and Confluence docs get stale quickly. Someone updates the code but forgets to update the documentation.

Tribal knowledge - the "just ask Sarah, she knows" approach - doesn't scale and creates single points of failure.

And in healthcare, we have regulatory requirements. Auditors need to see field-level documentation to understand what data we're storing about patients.
