Quick intro about me - I've been working in healthcare for 17 years, building systems that help clinicians make better decisions for patients.

I've been using Python for 8 years and Django for 7 years, so I've seen a lot of database confusion over the years.

The reason I'm passionate about this topic is that I've experienced firsthand how poor database documentation can slow down entire teams and even impact patient care systems.
