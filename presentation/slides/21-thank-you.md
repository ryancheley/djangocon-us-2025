# Thank You!

???

Thank you so much for your attention. I hope this simple Django feature can help reduce some of the database confusion in your teams.

Remember - documentation isn't just about helping others, it's about helping your future self six months from now when you're trying to remember what that field was supposed to do.

Enjoy the rest of DjangoCon!
