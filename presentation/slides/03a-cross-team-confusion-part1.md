# The Cross-Team Confusion

???

This is a real scenario from our healthcare system. I want to show you what happens when a developer adds a new database field without proper documentation.

Here's a typical Slack conversation that can happen in Health Care development teams


--

.slack-thread[
.slack-message[
.slack-user[@web-developer]: Just pushed new field `chads_score` to PatientRisk model
]
]

???

A web developer pushes a new field - looks innocent enough, right?
