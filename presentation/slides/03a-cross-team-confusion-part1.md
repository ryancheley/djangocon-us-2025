# The Cross-Team Confusion

???

This is a dramatized scenario from my organization via a "typical" Slack conversation


--

.slack-thread[
.slack-message[
.slack-user[@web-developer]: Just pushed new field `chads_score` to PatientRisk model
]
]

???

A web developer pushes a new field - looks innocent enough, right?
