# The Cross-Team Confusion (continued)

--

.slack-thread[
.slack-message[
.slack-user[@etl-dev]: Need to add this to risk dimension - but I also need to document what it's used for
]
]

???

But then the ETL developer sees this new field and knows that it needs to be added to the data warehouse.

.slack-thread[
.slack-message[
.slack-user[@report-dev]: Also need this for the new dashboard ... the sooner the data can be loaded into the Data Warehouse the better
]
]

???

And the report developer needs it for a new dashboard but they're blocked waiting for specifications.

This is where the pain starts - multiple teams are now blocked waiting for clarification.
