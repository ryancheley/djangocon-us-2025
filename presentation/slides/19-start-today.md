# Start Today - 3 Steps

???

You can start using this today. Here's my three-step approach:

--

1. **Audit:** Identify your top 10 confusing fields

???

First, audit your existing models. Look for fields with cryptic names or complex business logic. Start with your top 10 most confusing fields.

--

2. **Document:** Add `db_comment` with business context + compliance notes

???

Second, add db_comment to these fields. Include the business context, the calculation method, and any regulatory requirements. This is especially important in healthcare where compliance matters.

3. **Standardize:** Update code review templates

Third, make it part of your process. Update your code review checklist to require db_comment for new fields. Make documentation a habit, not an afterthought.
