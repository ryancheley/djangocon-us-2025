You can start using this today. Here's my three-step approach:

First, audit your existing models. Look for fields with cryptic names or complex business logic. Start with your top 10 most confusing fields.

Second, add db_comment to these fields. Include the business context, the calculation method, and any regulatory requirements. This is especially important in healthcare where compliance matters.

Third, make it part of your process. Update your code review checklist to require db_comment for new fields. Make documentation a habit, not an afterthought.
